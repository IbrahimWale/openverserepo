# Project Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and start both the frontend and backend of the project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
cd project
```

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection, API keys).
4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured in `.env`).
